# Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## How ```run_analysis.R``` works:
1 Require ```reshapre2``` and ```data.table``` libraries.

2 Load test and train data

3 Load features and activity labels.

4 Extract mean and standard deviation columns.

5 Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively.

6 Merge data set.
